## What is NLP?
![whatisnlp](imgs/imgs_001/004.png)

## Why NLP is harder than CV (Computer Vision)?
* ambiguity:
    solving it by learning from data

## Machine Translation
### Statistical Machine Translation
![machine Translation](imgs/imgs_001/005.png)
The factory of n is too large, no one can stand this time complexity.

We will use another model to combine these two steps.

LM: language model, to get meaningful sentence with broken words.
